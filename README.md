# AutoCAD Piping and Instrumentation Project

This project showcases detailed 2D and 3D AutoCAD designs for Piping and Instrumentation systems, including industrial components such as pipes, flanges, reducers, bushings, tees, crosses, valves, bolts, vessels, and other fabricated elements. It demonstrates the practical application of AutoCAD in process design and mechanical drafting.

# Project Overview

The project focuses on developing complete piping layouts and instrumentation diagrams as per industrial standards. It covers both individual part drawings and full assembly layouts, representing real-world design practices used in process industries like chemical plants, oil refineries, and manufacturing facilities.

# Included Components

Pipes – standard process and utility lines of various diameters

Flanges – slip-on, weld neck, blind types with bolt hole patterns

Reducers – concentric and eccentric reducers for flow transition

Bushings – threaded and welded fittings

Tees and Crosses – equal and reducing types for branch connections

Valves – gate, globe, ball, and check valves with actuator details

Bolts and Fasteners – dimensioned bolts and nuts as per standard codes

Vessels – pressure and non-pressure vessels with nozzle connections

Supports and Hangers – pipe supports, clamps, and guides

Fabricated Drawings – detailed dimensioned fabrication-level drawings

# Features
